# FUNCTION ARGUMENTS

A function can be declared to receive any number of arguments. Arguments can be from any type. An argument could be a string, a number, an array, an object and even another function.

Here is an example:

``` js
function example (firstArg, secondArg) {
  console.log(firstArg, secondArg);
}
```

We can **call** that function with two arguments like this:

``` js
example('hello', 'world');
```

The above example will print to the terminal `hello world`.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `function-arguments.js`.

In that file, define a function named `math` that takes three arguments. It's important for you to understand that arguments names are only used to reference them.

Name each argument as you like.

The function `math` should multiply the second and third arguments, then add the first argument to the outcome of the multiplication and return the value obtained.

After that, inside the parentheses of `console.log()`, call the `math()` function with the number 53 as first argument, the number 61 as second and the number 67 as third argument.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify function-arguments.js`
