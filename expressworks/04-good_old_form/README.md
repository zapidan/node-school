Write a route (`'/form'`) that processes HTML form input
(`<form><input name="str"/></form>`) and prints backwards the `str` value.

-----------------------------

## HINTS

To handle POST request use the `post()` method which is used the same way as `get()`:

```
app.post('/path', function(req, res){...})
```

Express.js uses middleware to provide extra functionality to your web server.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own
request handler.

Middlewares provide a large variety of functionalities such as logging, serving
static files and error handling.

A middleware is added by calling `use()` on the application and passing the
middleware as a parameter.

To parse `x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies Express.js can use `urlencoded()`
middleware from the `body-parser` module.

```
var bodyparser = require('body-parser')
app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
```

The documentation of the body-parser module can be found here:

  https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser

Here is how we can flip the characters:

```
req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
```

## NOTE

When creating your projects from scratch, install the `body-parser` dependency
with npm by running:

```
$ npm install body-parser
```

â€¦in your terminal.

Again, the port to use is passed {appname} to the application as `process.argv[2]`.
