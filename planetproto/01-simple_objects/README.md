Simple objects
=============

There are many way of creating objects in JavaScript, but the simplest way is
by using object literals:

```js
var alien = {
	legs: 3
};
```

Challenge
--------

Write a program that:

- Create an object called 'robot' using an object literal
- robot should have a property 'smart' with value true
- Claim the result robot.smart

Boilerplate
-----------

A file 010.js with the necessary boilerplate has been created for you. This 
files contains the instructions and placeholders for your code.

At the end of each boilerplate you will see a common js export 
`modules.exports = ...`. This is there to aid the verifier, please don't modify
that section.

Note the `__` placeholders in the boilerplate. You should replace this with your own code.

Claims
-----

Sometimes the challenge will ask you to make a claim. We have provided claim as 
a global function.

To make a claim write `claim(actual, expected)`, e.g.:

```js
claim(1 === 1, true);
```

Verification
------

When you are done, you must run:

$ {appname} verify 010.js
to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the 
lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
