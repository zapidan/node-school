Prototype lookups are dynamic
===================

You can add properties to the prototype of an object at any time, the prototype chain lookup will find the new property as expected.

```js
var alien = {}

var zippy = {}
zippy.__proto__ = alien

// zippy doesn't respond to kind at this point
console.log(zippy.kind); //=> undefined

// let's add kind to alien
alien.kind = 'alien'

// now zippy responds to kind
// because it finds 'kind' in alien
console.log(zippy.kind); //=> 'alien'
```

Keypoints
---------

- Objects delegate property lookups to their prototype.
- A prototype can be shared between objects.
