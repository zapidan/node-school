'this' is assigned implicitly
-------------------

When we use '__new__' with a function, JavaScript injects an implicit reference to the new object being created in the form of the ‘__this__’ keyword. It also returns this reference implicitly at the end of the function. 

When we do this:

```js
function Alien() {
	this.kind = 'alien'
}

var zippy = new Alien();
zippy.kind //=> 'alien'
```

Behind the scenes it is like doing something like:

```js
function Alien() {
	var this = {}; // this is not valid, just for illustration
	this.__proto__ = Alien.prototype;
	
	this.kind = 'alien'
	
	return this;
}
```

But keep in mind that the implicit '__this__' is only assigned to a new object when using '__new__'. If you forget '__new__' keyword then '__this__' will be the global object. Of course forgetting __new__ is a cause of multiple bugs, so don't forget __new__. 

One popular convention is to capitalize the first letter of a function when it is intended to be used as a function constructor e.g. 'Alien', so you know straight away that you are missing the __new__ keyword.
