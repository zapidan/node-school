# Challenge

Write a program that will receive two command line arguments containing
the hostname and port. Using `http.request` send a POST request to

```
url + '/users/create'
```

with the body containing a `JSON.stringify`'ed object:

```
{"user_id": 1}
```

Do this five times with each time the `user_id` property being incremented,
starting at 1.

Once these requests are done, send a GET request to:

```
url + '/users'
```

and `console.log` the response body for the GET request.

## Hints

In this problem, you will need to co-ordinate a few async operations.

Use `async.series` for this and pass in an `Object`. One of the task
functions will need to use `async.times` to send POST requests using
`http.request`. The other will then do the GET request.

You can read more about `async.times` here:
