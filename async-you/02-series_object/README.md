In this problem we will learn to use `async.series`.

The main difference between the `waterfall` and `series` functions is that the
result from a task function in `async.series` **won't be passed along** to the next
function once it completes. `series` will **collect all results as an array**
and pass it to the **optional callback** that runs **once all of the task functions
have completed**. For example:

``` js
async.series([
  function(callback){
    setTimeout(function() {
      callback(null, 'one');
    }, 200);
  },
  function(callback){
    setTimeout(function() {
      callback(null, 'two');
    }, 100);
  }
],
// optional callback
function(err, results){
  // results is now equal to ['one', 'two']
});
```

Instead of using an array as the result container `async.series` can use an
object, running each property and creating a result object with the same
properties. The above example can be written like so:

``` js
async.series({
  one: function(done){
    done(null, '1');
  },
  two: function(done){
    done(null, '2');
  }
}, function(err, results){
  console.log(results);
  // results will be {one: 1, two: 2}
});
```

## Challenge

Write a program that will receive two URLs as the first and second command-line arguments.

Using `http.get`, create a GET request to these URLs and pass the response body
to the callback.

Pass in an object of task functions, using the property names `requestOne` and
`requestTwo`, to `async.series`.

`console.log` the results in the callback for series when all the task functions
have completed.
